                        <p> 
                        &emsp;A wife and mother of a beautiful little 2-year-old girl.  She is the light of her husband
                        and daughter's lives and is everything that they could ever wish for.  Having a family has always been 
                        a dream of hers and she feels wholehearted life fulfillment ever since beginning this family 
                        trio.  She loves spending days with her husband and child, whether taking a drive in her 
                        favorite season, spring, or grabbing a mocha latte at the local coffee shop, she loves the 
                        presence of the family.  The place she would go right now, if she could, would be the 
                        Philippines, which is the home of Jollibee, her favorite fast-food restaurant.  The most 
                        beautiful place she has ever personally seen is Half Moon Kay in the Bahamas.  Ever since 
                        her husband and her went there in 2019, they have always wanted to return.  They are 
                        hopeful that maybe this is the year, but with their daughter to share the experience of sights, 
                        smells and the feeling of beach sand between their toes.<br><br>
                        &emsp;This amazing wife does believe that good people can do bad things in life, yet she 
                        still has faith, which gives her hope.  Since her primary definition of success in life is being 
                        happy and content with what one has, she has definitely already achieved this great 
                        success.  You couldn’t ask for a better mother and wife than her.  She is dedicated to family 
                        and a lovely person with an outstanding perspective on life.<br><br>
                        &emsp;Even though she has already completed her life goals and achievements, there are 
                        still things that she would love to do in her life.  She wants to continue being the caring and 
                        loving wife and mother that she has consistently already embodied, but there is a possibility 
                        that a playful food fight may be in her future.  This is something she has never done, but with 
                        a toddler child, the chances of this occurring have moved into a high probability range.  She 
                        seems like the playful mother that would use that opportunity to bond and perhaps create a 
                        teaching moment as well.  This mother is one that anyone could wish for, food fight or not, 
                        and her husband is proud of her beyond words.
